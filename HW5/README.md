# Goal 

## Problem 1:
Students were asked to construct a linear regression model to predict GFR using the following predictors from the baseg.csv dataset: 

1) Serum Creatinine (bascre); 2) Systolic blood pressure (sbase); 3) Diastolic blood pressure (dbase); 4)Urine protein (baseu); 5) Age; 6) Gender (Sex = 1 if male; = 0 if female); 7) African-American (black)


## Problem 2:
Students were asked to construct a logistic regression model to predict the decision to switch wells using the following predictors from the wells.csv dataset:

1) arsenic (the level of arsenic in the well in hundreds of micrograms per liter); 2)dist (the distance to the nearest safe well in meters) ; 3)assoc (whether household members are active in community organizations); 4) educ is the number of years of education of the head of household.
